Excel is a powerful tool for data and business analysis, and Python is one of the worldâ€™s most popular and dynamic programming languages. Python in Excel works as a sandbox environment. It enables developers and business users to test small parts of code by creating visuals and running algorithms on existing data. In this course, data analytics and business analysis expert Helen Wall focuses on how Python can expand the existing capabilities of Excel. Explore the process and framework of setting up Python to create DataFrame objects and other outputs in Excel. Dive into ways you can use these outputs and objects in custom data visualizations and algorithms that Excel does not have natively, but which Python can create with code. This course highlights ways you can harness the strengths of both Excel and Python in one interface.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
